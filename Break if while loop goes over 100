1 - Ask the user to input a water temperature

2 - While the water temperature is lower than 100 keep printing "The water isn't hot enough". Add 20 to the water temperature every time.

3 - If water temperature become over 100 then print "The water is boiling"

Make sure that your output fits with the examples.



i = 20
total = int(input ("What is the temperature of the water?"))
while True:
    if total < 100:
        print("The water isn't hot enough")
    if total >= 100:
        print("The water is boiling")
        break
    total += i
