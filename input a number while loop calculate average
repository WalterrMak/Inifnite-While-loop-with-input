Use while loop for creating a program that allows user to input numbers and calculates the average.
1 - Ask user how many numbers will be inputted.
2 - Ask user "Enter number" based on how many numbers user wants to input.
3 - Calculate the average of those numbers.









sum = 0
numbers= int(input("How many numbers will you be inputting?"))
count = numbers
while count > 0:
    count = count-1
    num = int(input("Enter number"))
    sum = sum + num
    average = sum / numbers
print("The average is", average)
